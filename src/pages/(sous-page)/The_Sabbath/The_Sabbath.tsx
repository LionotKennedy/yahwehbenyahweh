          Earth were finished, and all the host of them,{" "}

          descendants, and all the families of the Earth to obey, comply with,
          and conform to, as LAW, the observance of the{" "}
          <strong>SEVENTH DAY</strong> as a day of REST to observe and to honor
          the memory of Him for ALL HIS “WORK”—HIS CREATION—which He,{" "}

          In order to keep the law of the <strong>SABBATH</strong>, we must keep

          In Genesis 2:2-3, <span className="David-sab">יהוה</span> blessed the{" "}

          the <strong>SABBATH</strong> of{" "}
          <span className="David-sab">יהוה</span>. And in it, the Sabbath, NO
          ONE is to do “any” work (Exodus 20:8-10). It is a “holy” day devoted
          entirely to reflecting upon and giving “exclusive” honor to{" "}

          for the stunning beauty of all His WORK, which He produced. Keeping
          the <strong>SABBATH</strong> is also a “direct” manifestation to{" "}

          The <strong>SABBATH</strong> is a “SIGN” between only{" "}

          honoring Him for the amazing elegance or gracefulness of ALL that He
          formed and fashioned. Our commemoration of this day serves as proof to{" "}
