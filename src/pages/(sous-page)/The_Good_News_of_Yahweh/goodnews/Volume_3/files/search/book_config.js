But did you know that only one\u000d\u000abook has been written that can describe our \u000d\u000apast, govern our present, and predict our \u000d\u000afuture? That one Book is the Bible, and it \u000d\u000ais considered the Good Book by people from \u000d\u000aall over the world, no matter what language \u000d\u000athey speak. \u000d\u000aThere are any number of biblical accounts of \u000d\u000aScriptures, while written in the past, that can \u000d\u000aforetell the future by pointing out signs that \u000d\u000acan be readily identifiable in the present day.\u000d\u000aOne such Scripture is Matthew, Chapter 24, \u000d\u000averse 6, in which we are told that hearing \u000d\u000aof wars and rumors of wars is a sign of the \u000d\u000aAdvent, or Coming of the Son of Man, the \u000d\u000aChrist, %&%* 0v %&%*, and of the end of this \u000d\u000aworld as we know it.\u000d\u000aIn fact, in our last article, found in volume \u000d\u000atwo of the Good News magazine, it was \u000d\u000aestablished through the use of the ten step \u000d\u000astudy method of %&%* 0v %&%* that there \u000d\u000aare many different kinds of\u000d\u000awars signaling His return, \u000d\u000asuch as: military wars, \u000d\u000acurrency wars, trade wars, \u000d\u000afamily wars, AI and cyber \u000d\u000awars, war on poverty, \u000d\u000awar on drugs, but most \u000d\u000aimportantly word wars.\u000d\u000aWe expressed that only in this generation \u000d\u000adoes technology exist permitting us to \u000d\u000abe able to hear of these wars and watch \u000d\u000asimultaneously the fall of humanity globally\u000d\u000aon 24-hour worldwide cable networks and \u000d\u000astreaming services.

Rodale\u2019s Synonym Finder, \u000d\u000acopyright 1978, on page 366; and on page \u000d\u000a155, central is synonymous to \u201cinternal.\u201d \u000d\u000aThus, as Satan had planned, Adam and Eve\u2019s \u000d\u000ainternal nature was altered making them \u000d\u000aweak, lacking moral strength, and subject to \u000d\u000adeath (Genesis 2:17, 3:4). \u000d\u000aSo, in this article, we will concentrate on what \u000d\u000ais actually being modified when anyone falls\u000d\u000avictim from the serpent\u2019s encouragement to \u000d\u000aeat of the fruit which is in the midst of the \u000d\u000agarden (Genesis 3:1-3).\u000d\u000aWe have already shown that eating from \u000d\u000athis tree will genetically modify your internal \u000d\u000anature.
