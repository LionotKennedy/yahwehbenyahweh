          On November 7, 1990, the U. S. Government arrested{" "}
          <span className="David-cru">יהוה&nbsp;בּן&nbsp;יהוה</span> and 16 of
          His followers in a pre-dawn, terrorist attack against the religion.
          Following a 25-year F.B.I practice of disrupting and discrediting
          black organizations, hundreds of government agents coordinated the
          attack. According to the testimony of an F.B.I. case agent, The Nation
          of <span className="David-cru">יהוה</span> had been under close
          surveillance for nearly 10 years.

          In 7 different states, members of The Nation of{" "}

          strip searched, and laid out on the cold, hard street.

          With no real evidence to prosecute, the FEDERAL GOVERNMENT indicted
          the Nation of <span className="David-cru">יהוה</span> under R.I.C.O.
          (Racketeering Influenced Corrupt Organizations), setting a dangerous
          precedent. Because of the FIRST AMENDMENT issues that protect
          religion, many legal and religious scholars were shocked but showed no
          outrage.

          As their star witness, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT relied upon ROBERT
          “LYING BOB” ROZIER, a confessed serial killer and drug abuser. (“LYING
          BOB’s” own parents failed to testify to his character during the
          trial.) In return for his testimony, “LYING BOB” was rewarded with a
          reduced sentence after pleading guilty to killing 4 people.

          Under oath, a high-ranking JUSTICE DEPARTMENT official admitted that
          the case was weak and the R.I.C.O. charges gave it “A BETTER CHANCE OF
          STICKING.”

          When the evidence was heard in state court, without the confusion of
          the FEDERAL R.I.C.O. charges, the jury returned a swift, UNANIMOUS
          VERDICT of “NOT GUILTY” to all allegations. “NOT GUILTY” to all
          defendants.

          After 5 1/2 days of deliberation, the federal jury complained 4 times
          of their inability to agree upon a decision. They were confused.
          Ultimately, they convicted{" "}
          <span className="David-cru">יהוה&nbsp;בּן&nbsp;יהוה</span> OF
          “CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT R.I.C.O.” out of CONFUSION and IGNORANCE.

          In spite of what we now know to be perjury and manipulation of the

          serve an 18-year sentence. He spent 6 years at LEWISBURG PENITENTIARY,
          the worst prison in the U. S. PENAL SYSTEM, located in Lewisburg,
          Pennsylvania, and subsequent time at FCI Raybrook located in Raybrook,

          mistreated. He was placed in solitary confinement, denied meals,

          against His will. Other inmates were denied emergency medical care
          because of their association with Him.
