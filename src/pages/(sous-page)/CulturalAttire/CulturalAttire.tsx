          If one is not aware of how God dresses, one will not recognize Him at

          White is a supreme emblem associated with purity and oneness. The
          wearing of white symbolizes that a cleansing process is taking place—a
          purging of sin and a returning to the order of obeisance. "Though your
          sins are as scarlet, they shall be white as snow" (Isaiah 1:18). In
          the Kingdom of <span className="David-cul">יהוה</span>, the wearing of
          white is eternal, both physically and spiritually (Ecclesiastes 9:8).
          It signifies the ushering in of a new era, a new form of ethical and
          moral standards, a morally good government; the Theocratic government
          of <span className="David-cul">יהוה</span>.
