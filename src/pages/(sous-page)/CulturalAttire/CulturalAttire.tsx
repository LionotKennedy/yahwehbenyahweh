          White is a supreme emblem associated with purity and oneness. The wearing of white symbolizes that a cleansing
          process is taking place—a purging of sin and a returning to the order of obeisance. "Though your sins are as
          scarlet, they shall be white as snow" (Isaiah 1:18). In the Kingdom of{" "}
          <span className="David">יהוה</span>, the wearing of white is eternal, both physically and spiritually
          (Ecclesiastes 9:8). It signifies the ushering in of a new era, a new form of ethical and moral standards, a
          morally good government; the Theocratic government of <span className="David">יהוה</span>.
