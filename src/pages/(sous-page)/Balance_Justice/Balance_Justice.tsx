          The Abraham Foundation, Inc., was founded for the specific purpose of
          raising funds for the legal defense of innocent, indigent Hebrew
          Israelites and others selected by the Foundation. These funds help pay
          for attorneys’ fees, private investigators, compilation and
          reproduction of legal documents, travel, and hotel accommodations for
          attorneys and witnesses, plus much, much more.

          The Foundation was responsible for putting together the legal teams
          that for more than sixteen years successfully defended{" "}
          <span className="David-bal">יהוה&nbsp;בּן&nbsp;יהוה</span>, the Leader
          of The Nation of <span className="David-bal">יהוה</span> and other
          Hebrew Israelites. These teams received numerous not guilty verdicts,
          procured many dismissed charges, negotiated an unprecedented plea
          bargain, acquired an early parole release, as well as assisted
          countless others seeking advice in both criminal and civil matters.

          the Foundation must continue to be ready for each new challenge, and
