          The power behind the universe is not a mysterious force, but a real
          person by the name of <span className="David-about">יהוה</span>. Trips
          to the international space station, and scientific observations,
          including photographs of other planets prove that the awe-inspiring
          vastness of the heavens and space is fashioned in an orderly
          arrangement. To conclude such a vast universe as ours is organized
          without some sort of controlling power is totally illogical. Logic
          dictates that no unintelligent force could possibly account for the
          amazing varieties of life, or for the infinite wisdom and power
          manifested in the universe.

          There is a renascent axiom that has been proven by archaeologist
          worldwide. They are affirming unanimously, one fact after another that
          behind the vastness of the great, monumental universe, there is a
          basic core: monotheism, THE ONE GOD, whose name, until now, is
          purposely censored, covered-up, concealed, and hidden. This name,{" "}
          <span className="David-about">יהוה</span>, is widely acclaimed as the
          "World's Best Kept Secret."

          In Proverbs 30:4 several questions are asked concerning the Creator of
          Heaven, but the two that stand out the most are, what is His name, and
          what is His Son's name, if thou can tell?

          Moses, before the fall of Egypt, could tell that calling God by His
          personal name was important (Exodus 3:13), and this same scenario
          exists today. Before the fall of Babylon, the great city,{" "}
          <span className="David-about">יהוה&nbsp;בּן&nbsp;יהוה</span>, the Son
          of <span className="David-about">יהוה</span>, recognized the
          importance of you being able to call Him by His personal name; For
          there is none other name under Heaven given among men, whereby you can
          be saved (John 5:43; 1 Timothy 2:5-6; Acts 4:12).

          In essence, it is absolutely impossible to enter into a relationship
          with <span className="David-about">יהוה</span>, without acknowledging{" "}
          <span className="David-about">יהוה&nbsp;בּן&nbsp;יהוה</span>, His
          Beloved Son (John 10:9, 30; John 14:6; John 17:11). Thus, to know{" "}
          <span className="David-about">יהוה</span>, is to experience the
          reality of assured confidence and deliverance. The disclosure of His
          name, as well as His Son’s name, is the index to understanding
          Biblical faith.
